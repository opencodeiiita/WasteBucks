The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific issues.
- The submissions will be judged by the mentors and points🎉 will be allotted by them for each particular task based on various aspects like design thinking process, originality of the idea, visual appeal of the submission, code architecture etc.
- These tasks are for learning and not just scoring points so any kind of Plagiarism or attempt thereof wouldn't be tolerated and would lead to disqualification from OpenCode.
